TITLE = WarthogKernel (Pre2)
DEVICE = pre2
CATEGORY = Beta
VERSIONS = 2.1.0-79
APPINFO_DESCRIPTION = In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight. Oh wait... <br><br>\
A collection of all the best kernel improvements for the Palm Pre2, rolled into a single OTA-safe installation package.<br>\
<b>Note that usage of this package is very likely to <a href=http://developer.palm.com/blog/2010/03/a-statement-on-the-overclocking-patches/>void your warranty</a> if things go wrong.</b><br>\
Current additions include:<ul>\
<li>A new 1.1 GHz kernel operating points, ported to the Palm Pre 2 by uNiXpSyChO.</li>\
<li>Automatic temperature limiting support, written by uNiXpSyChO, ka6sox & rwhitby specifically for the Palm Pre 2, which scales down the processor speed when a configurable temperature limit is reached.</li>\
<li>Automatic battery usage limiting support, written by uNiXpSyChO specifically for the Palm Pre 2, which scales down the processor speed when a configurable low battery limit is reached.</li>\
<li>A new <b>screenstate-v3</b> governor created by uNiXpSyChO specifically for the Palm Pre 2 which runs at a higher speed when the screen is on, and a lower speed when the screen is off. Screenstate-v3 also includes vdemand, which decreases and increases voltage in response to CPU load and ondemand frequency scaling while screen is on. See the Govnah help entries for more details.</li>\
<li>Modification of the lowmemnotify threshold calculation to take into account free swap space, written by rwhitby</li>\
<li>A new <a href=http://lwn.net/Articles/334649/><b>compcache</b> compressed RAM swap kernel module</a> ported to the Palm Pre/Pre+ by uNiXpSyChO & rwhitby</li>\
<li>The OMAP3630 internal CPU temperature sensor is made available for measuring the true CPU temperature, ported to the Palm Pre 2 by ka6sox & rwhitby.</li>\
<li>All standard Linux 2.6.24 <a href=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-cpufreq-1/index.html>cpufreq governors</a> made available for selection via the Govnah application.</li>\
<li>Additions to the USB mass storage driver for XBox 360 compatibility.  Note that your USB drive may be reformatted when you plug it into an XBox 360.</li>\
<li>Support for kernel crypto modules required by TrueCrypt</li>\
</ul><br>\
All additions are disabled by default, and must be enabled by using the Govnah application.<br>\
