Golf Caddie has been submitted to Palm so any additional feedback would be much appreciated.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><center> www.dtw-consulting.com/GolfCaddie </center><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Golf Caddie</strong> is a golf scoring application that also has GPS range finder (ala sky caddy) capabilites for webOS. It uses the existing course data provided by <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"www.bbgpsgolf.com\" href=\"http://www.bbgpsgolf.com/\">www.bbgpsgolf.com</a>, a free golf gps application for Blackberry users. This application comes with many features such as&#58; Create players with their current handicap, create and add courses locally from the <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"www.bbgpsgolf.com\" href=\"http://www.bbgpsgolf.com/\">www.bbgpsgolf.com</a> database.  Courses can be added by name or within x miles of your current location.  New courses can be can be added at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"www.bbgpsgolf.com\" href=\"http://www.bbgpsgolf.com/\">www.bbgpsgolf.com</a> website. Once you have players and courses in the application you can start a round of golf and keep scoring for up to four players. You can decided to play 18 holes or 9 holes, the front 9 first or the back 9 first. Scoring keeps track of shots, putts, GIR (done automatically) and fairways hit, FH. The score will also keep track of your current score to par.</p> <p>GPS data is also available (if available on the course data from <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"www.bbgpsgolf.com\" href=\"http://www.bbgpsgolf.com/\">www.bbgpsgolf.com</a>) and can be viewed for each hole quite easily. Distances normally show front, center and back of green as well as up to 5 additional items of interest. Golf Caddie will also suggest which club to use to the front, center and back of the green when in range. This is based upon the clubs in your bag (defined under preferences) and the min/max distance for each club.</p> <p>Once a round is complete a full scoring card can be seen for each player. The round can be saved and previous rounds can be viewed.</p> <p>Future features that will be added to the app are some of the following:</p> <ul><li>Addition of preferences to identify distances for each club that will allow for a club suggestion when playing a shot. (DONE)</li><li>Ability to edit course data such as add additional tees. (DONE)</li><li>Keep track of driving distances(DONE), penalty shots and sand saves.</li><li>Provide statistics for each player that has a score in the app. (DONE)</li><li>Keep track of all players handicaps by updating them at the end of a round. (DONE)</li></ul> <p>Licensing conditions&#58; This application is available for free whilst it is in Beta realse, but cannot be redistributed, and the source code is not open source. This application is being submitted to the Pre App Store and will be available to purchase at that time.</p> <p>Installation&#58; No special instructions are required, the app should install/delete like most other homebrew apps using the SDK method.</p> <p>Playing instructions:</p> <ul>Start the app and create at least 1 player.  Ideally the first player that is created should be identified as the Pre owner.</ul> <ul>Search for courses and save the courses to the local application database. Existing tees will be downloaded with the course if they exist, otherwise default Blue tees will be created.</ul> <ul>Start a round of golf. Choose the course, the tees and up to 4 players. Choose to play 18 holes or 9 holes, front 9 first or back 9 first.</ul> <ul>On the score card there are numerous options available. The score and putts are tapable and can easily be selected. The FH (fairway hit) can be tapped to set the checkmark. GIR is automatically calculated based on the score, par and number of putts so no need to do anything here. It is displayed to show if the GIR was achieved. Moving between holes can be done in a couple of ways. Select either the left or right arrows in the upper part of the screen to move to the next or previous hole, or tap the hole number to move directly to another hole. Tapping on any of the 4 players names will bring up that players detailed scorecard. Tapping the GPS button will bring up the GPS data for the hole. At this moment in time the Mark button doesn't do anything but will be used in a future feature to keep track of driving distances.</ul> <ul>At the end of a round the app will let you know if any holes were missed. You'll still have the option to save to round, but incomplete rounds cannot be used to calculate and update handicaps.</ul> <p>The GPS may take some time to settle so please allow for this time before playing your shot.</p> <p>A special thanks goes out to the developer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"www.bbgpsgolf\" href=\"http://www.bbgpsgolf/\">www.bbgpsgolf</a> for allowing me access to the course data and for being available to modify his APIs.</p>", "Category":"Location and Travel", "Screenshots":["http://www.precentral.net/sites/precentral.net/files/webos-homebrew-apps/32707/GolfCaddie_0.png","http://www.precentral.net/sites/precentral.net/files/webos-homebrew-apps/32707/GC-PlayerScreen_0.jpg","http://www.precentral.net/sites/precentral.net/files/webos-homebrew-apps/32707/GC-CoursesScreen_0.jpg","http://www.precentral.net/sites/precentral.net/files/webos-homebrew-apps/32707/GC-NewRoundScreen-4_0.jpg","http://www.precentral.net/sites/precentral.net/files/webos-homebrew-apps/32707/ScoreCard1_0.jpg","http://www.precentral.net/sites/precentral.net/files/webos-homebrew-apps/32707/gps1.jpg"], "Source":"http://www.precentral.net/sites/precentral.net/files/webos-homebrew-apps/feeds/com.dtw-consulting.golfcaddie.trial_1.0.0_all.ipk", "Type":"Application", "Feed":"PreCentral" }

Begin by entering a tracking number from one of the supported couriers and Pack &lsquo;n&rsquo; Track will begin tracking your package immediately.  Don&rsquo;t worry about specifying which courier the number belongs to as Pack &lsquo;n&rsquo; Track is smart enough to figure out which tracking numbers belong to each currier.  Pack &lsquo;n&rsquo; Track is integrated into the WebOs environment so it still tracks your packages even if it is not open on your phone using minimal resources!  Pack &lsquo;n&rsquo; Track will also provide you with status change notifications each time the courier updates the status of you package.  These notifications work just like your email notifications and are configurable so you can even turn them completely off or have Pack &lsquo;n&rsquo; Track only notify you when the package has been delivered.  In addition to status notifications, Pack &lsquo;n&rsquo; Track will also provide you with some additional details (subject to courier availability) about your package such as its estimated date of arrival, the package&rsquo;s weight, what service the package was shipped under, who signed for it once delivered, and where it was left at when delivered.  It doesn&rsquo;t stop there though, we are working hard to bring you additional courier and useful tools such as a zip code finder/decoder, the ability to find shipping locations near you, and an estimated shipping cost calculator plus much much more!</p>   <p>We still don't fully support FedEx Smart Post or USPS Mailbox Innovations.
