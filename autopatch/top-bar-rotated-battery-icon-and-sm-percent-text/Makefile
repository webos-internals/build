TITLE = Rotated Battery Icon And Sm Percent Text
DESCRIPTION = Based on the Battery icon and percent patches in Preware by nesl247, Jason Robitaille, frause and the rotated version by Vincent Law (MIT license) -  This variation makes the text of battery percent value above of the rotated battery icon smaller (10px). The battery icon is rotated 270 degrees and shifted 1px in from the right of the top bar to better center it below the battery percent text.
